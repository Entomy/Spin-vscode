# About

This extension provides support for Spin, the primary language for programming the [Parallax Propeller](https://www.parallax.com/catalog/microcontrollers/propeller).

# Help Me Out

Good quality extensions take a lot of time. Considerably more than just "meh, close enough" level work. If you'd like to help out but don't know how to contribute to the code, consider donating to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Entomy). Leave a message with the donation about it being for this extension, and I'll weight my work towards this.

# Works Best With
* [Offbase](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Entomy.offbase) although any theme will work well.
